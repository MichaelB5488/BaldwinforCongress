    <h2>Meet Michael</h2>
    <p>
      Michael Baldwin is running for Congress to bring common sense, transparency, and real representation 
      back to New Jersey’s 10th District. As a husband and father of two — an energetic one‑year‑old and a 
      curious eight‑year‑old — Michael knows what working families are facing every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He’s not backed by political machines or corporate donors — he’s backed by real people who are tired 
      of being ignored. Michael’s mission is simple: fight for practical solutions, accountability, and a 
      Congress that actually works for the people it serves.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Michael is Running</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To give voters a real independent choice — not the same recycled party politics.</li>
      <li>To focus on safer communities, economic opportunity, and affordable living.</li>
      <li>To bring transparency, fairness, and honesty to Washington.</li>
    </ul>
